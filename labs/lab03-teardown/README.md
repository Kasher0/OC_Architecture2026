Pair: Kazhymurat + Arsen · Date: 04.11.2026

## Part 1 — Ten parts

### 1. AMD Ryzen 5 7600
![AMD Ryzen 5 7600](evidence/photos/ryzen5-7600.png)

**What it is:** 6 cores / 12 threads, Zen 4 ("Raphael"), 3.8 GHz base, up to 5.1 GHz boost, 32 MB L3, 65 W default TDP, integrated Radeon graphics (2 cores).
**Connects to:** socket **AM5** (boards with A620 / B650 / B650E / B840 / B850 / X670 / X670E / X870 / X870E chipsets). Its memory controller is **DDR5 only**, 2 channels. PCIe 5.0.
**Limit:** fits only AM5 boards and only DDR5 memory (no DDR4). Official memory speed is DDR5-5200 with two modules (DDR5-3600 with four); faster kits run as an overclock profile.

### 2. Intel Core i5-13400
![Intel Core i5-13400](evidence/photos/core-i5-13400.png)

**What it is:** 10 cores (6 Performance + 4 Efficient), 16 threads, P-core base 2.5 GHz, max turbo 4.6 GHz, 20 MB Intel Smart Cache, 65 W base power, integrated Intel UHD Graphics 730.
**Connects to:** socket **FCLGA1700**. Memory controller takes **DDR5-4800 or DDR4-3200**, 2 channels (which one is used is decided by the board's slots). PCIe 5.0 and 4.0, 20 lanes.
**Limit:** fits only LGA1700 boards. It supports both memory generations, but a given board has only one kind of slot, so the board decides.

### 4. MSI PRO B760M-A WIFI DDR4
![MSI PRO B760M-A WIFI DDR4](evidence/photos/msi-b760m-a-wifi-ddr4.png)

**What it is:** micro-ATX motherboard, chipset Intel B760, socket LGA1700, Wi-Fi 6E + 2.5G LAN.
**Connects to:** LGA1700 CPU; 4 × **DDR4** DIMM slots (dual channel, up to 128 GB); 2 × M.2 (M2_1 from the CPU, PCIe 4.0 x4; M2_2 from the chipset, PCIe 4.0 x4 or SATA mode); 4 × SATA 6 Gb/s.
**Limit:** only LGA1700 CPUs and only DDR4: a DDR5 stick will not fit the slot.

### 5. Kingston FURY Beast DDR5-5600, 16 GB
![Kingston FURY Beast DDR5](evidence/photos/kingston-fury-beast-ddr5.png)

**What it is:** DDR5 UDIMM, 16 GB (one module), 5600 MT/s (PC5-44800), CL40, 1.25 V, 288 pins, on-die ECC.
**Connects to:** a 288-pin DDR5 DIMM slot. One module means one memory channel is used, the second stays empty.
**Limit:** fits only DDR5 boards (the notch is in a different place than on DDR4). The speed is also capped by the CPU: the Ryzen 5 7600 officially tops out at DDR5-5200 with two modules, so 5600 is reached only through an overclock profile.

### 6. Crucial DDR4-3200, 16 GB DIMM
![Crucial DDR4-3200](evidence/photos/crucial-ddr4-3200.png)

**What it is:** DDR4 UDIMM, 16 GB, 3200 MT/s (PC4-25600), 288 pins, 1.2 V.
**Connects to:** a 288-pin DDR4 DIMM slot, one per channel.
**Limit:** fits only DDR4 boards. 3200 MT/s is exactly the top official DDR4 speed of the Core i5-13400.

### 7. Samsung 990 PRO 1 TB
![Samsung 990 PRO](evidence/photos/samsung-990-pro.png)

**What it is:** NVMe SSD, 1 TB, form factor M.2 2280, interface PCIe 4.0 x4 (NVMe 2.0), up to 7,450 MB/s sequential read and 6,900 MB/s write.
**Connects to:** an M.2 Key M slot that provides PCIe lanes. No data or power cable.
**Limit:** the bus: it runs at PCIe 4.0 x4 speed at best, and an M.2 slot that is SATA-only would not work.

## Step 3 — The motherboards

| | ASUS PRIME B650M-A | MSI PRO B760M-A WIFI DDR4 |
|---|---|---|
| Socket | AM5 | LGA1700 |
| Chipset | AMD B650 | Intel B760 |
| Memory | DDR5, 4 slots | DDR4, 4 slots |
| Storage | 2 × M.2 (PCIe 4.0 x4), 4 × SATA | 2 × M.2 (PCIe 4.0 x4; M2_2 also SATA mode), 4 × SATA |
| CPUs accepted | Ryzen 7000, 8000, 9000 | Core 12th, 13th and 14th gen, Pentium Gold, Celeron |
| BIOS update needed? | Not necessary, but recommended | Not necessary |


## Two builds

### Build 1 — AMD

| Part | Model | Why it fits here |
|---|---|---|
| Processor | AMD Ryzen 5 7600 | needs socket AM5 |
| Motherboard | ASUS PRIME B650M-A | has socket AM5, B650 chipset is in the 7600's supported list |
| Memory | Kingston FURY Beast DDR5-5600 16 GB | the 7600 and this board are DDR5 only |
| SSD | Samsung 990 PRO 1 TB | M.2 Key M slot with PCIe 4.0 x4 matches the drive's interface |
| Power | Corsair RM750e | has the 24-pin and CPU 8-pin the board needs; 750 W is far more than a 65 W CPU with integrated graphics needs |
| Cooler | AMD Wraith Stealth | ships with the 7600, AM5 mounting |

### Build 2 — Intel

| Part | Model | Why it fits here |
|---|---|---|
| Processor | Intel Core i5-13400 | needs socket LGA1700 |
| Motherboard | MSI PRO B760M-A WIFI DDR4 | has LGA1700, takes 13th gen |
| Memory | Crucial DDR4-3200 16 GB | the board has only DDR4 slots; 3200 is the CPU's DDR4 maximum |
| SSD | Samsung 870 EVO 1 TB | the board has 4 SATA ports; 2.5-inch SATA drive |
| Cooler | Intel boxed cooler |AMD Wraith Stealth cooler |

### What each build still needs

- **Build 1:** a case, a keyboard and monitor, an operating system. No graphics card is needed (the 7600 has integrated graphics; the board has video outputs).
- **Build 2:** everything above, **plus a power supply**, because the parts list has only one (the RM750e went to Build 1). It also needs a SATA data cable for the 870 EVO and a SATA power connector from the PSU.
- Both builds have only one 16 GB module, so memory runs in single-channel mode with two empty slots; a second identical module would add a channel.
<!-- CHECK: whether the MSI box includes a SATA cable and the Wi-Fi antenna: read the "What's in the box" section on msi.com -->

## Part 2 — Same facts, three operating systems

Windows is my laptop (the host). Linux is the Ubuntu VM from Lab 1, so it describes the **virtual** machine, not the laptop. No Mac in the pair, so the macOS column shows the commands from the lab guide but they were **not run**.

| Fact | Windows (PowerShell) | Linux (Ubuntu VM) | macOS (not run) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU model | `Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor \| Select Name` | `lscpu` (line "Model name") | `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` |
| Cores / threads | `Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor \| Select NumberOfCores, NumberOfLogicalProcessors` | `lscpu` ("Core(s) per socket", "CPU(s)") | `sysctl hw.physicalcpu hw.logicalcpu` |
| Total memory | `Get-CimInstance Win32_PhysicalMemory \| Select Capacity` (sum of modules) | `free -h` | `sysctl hw.memsize` |
| Memory modules and speed | `Get-CimInstance Win32_PhysicalMemory \| Select DeviceLocator, Capacity, Speed, ConfiguredClockSpeed, SMBIOSMemoryType, FormFactor` | `sudo dmidecode -t memory` | `system_profiler SPMemoryDataType` |
| Disk model and type | `Get-PhysicalDisk \| Select FriendlyName, MediaType, BusType, Size` | `lsblk -d -o NAME,MODEL,ROTA,TRAN,SIZE` | `diskutil info disk0` |
| Free space | `Get-Volume C` | `df -h /` | `df -h /` |
| Architecture | `$env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE` | `uname -m` | `uname -m` |

executing the command in powershell information showed me CPU model 34 (means DDR5), while in ubuntu its showed as 25 (DDR4). Also 16 Cores in my laptop versus 4 Cores in linux ubuntu

## What did not work the first time

I was struggling to execute command to get information from ubuntu-serverr. So basically I just executed a consequative commands (sudo - v, mkdir -p ~/evidence, { echo '$ lscpu'; lscpu; } >> ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt, { echo '$ free -h'; free -h; } >> ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt, { echo '$ free -h'; free -h; } >> ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt, { echo '$ sudo dmidecode -t memory'; sudo dmidecode -t memory; } >> ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt, { echo '$ lsblk -d -o NAME,MODEL,ROTA,TRAN,SIZE'; lsblk -d -o NAME,MODEL,ROTA,TRAN,SIZE; } >> ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt, { echo '$ df -h /'; df -h /; } >> ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt and { echo '$ uname -m'; uname -m; } >> ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt) and checked that they all were executed by cat ~/evidence/linux-specs.txt command

## Evidence

- [evidence/linux-specs.txt](evidence/linux-specs.txt) — each Linux command with its raw output, from the VM
